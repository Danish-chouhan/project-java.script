## indexOf
> if we want to know about index of any walue then we use indexOf method i show u how it is
```javascript
var a = ["danish" , "uzair" , "fayyaz" ,"uzair", "ayyaz"]
document.write(a + "<br><br>")
var b = a.indexOf("uzair" , 2)
document.write(b)
```
> in this we have two parameter ("value" , start)
> this is showing that what is the index of your value and if u have to same value then the parameter counts first index first this is why we use start parameter too
----
