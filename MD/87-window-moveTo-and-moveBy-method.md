# moveTo-and-moveBy
> in this we are learning about
how to give position from top and left
so first we learn about moveby
# moveto
> in this i have to show u structure first 
in this we use previes thing name ow() function in this i will expain u moveBy() in this we make a button named move and give a event on click to them now i explain u the structure of js
```javascript
 var a;
function ow(){
    a = window.open("","","width=200px,height=200px");
    a.document.write("<p>hlw this is my window</p>")

}

function mb(){
    a.moveTo(200,200)
}
```
> in this we are maked a mb() function an  give a moveto keyword and in parameter we give some digit number to left and top
this will work when you hve your persnal web url  otherwise you creat a docemnt.write and write something into this 
so this is moveto option 
---
> now we talk about moveby method
```javascript
var a;
function ow(){
    a = window.open("","","width=200px,height=200px");
    a.document.write("<p>hlw this is my window</p>")

}

function mb(){
    a.moveBy(200,200)
}
```
> in is an diference between moveTo and moveby 
moveTo -> change there positin by obsalute value
and 
moveBy -> change there position by reletive value
these are difference and all things all same
