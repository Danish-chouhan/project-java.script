# IF ELSE- STATMENT 
> how the if statment 
so
we have a single value but to statement then we use (if statment) and (else)if the value is true then if can show and if the value is false then else can handle it 
so the pattern is 
```javascript 
var a = 20
var b = 10

if(a > b){
    document.write("a is greater")
}else{
    document.write("b is greater")
}
```
> so this is how we can use if else statement
