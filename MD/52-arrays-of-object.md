    {name : 'fayyaz' , age : 17},
    {name : 'uzair' , age : 17},
];
for(var a = 0 ; a < students.length ; a++ ){
    document.write(students[a].name + " " + students[a].age + "<br>")
}
```
> now i tell u what is ths and how is this working 
fist we make a varieable and named him (students)
then we open a array bracket i mean square bracket
then we make 4 object with oters name and ages 
then we make a for loop becouse we want a loop wise sequence if we dont use a loop then this show only one time in his condition we writ ( lenght) becouse length work at the end point of array 
then we call them
