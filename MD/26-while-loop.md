# WHILE LOOP
[JS FILE](./26-while-loop.md)

>THERE ARE 5 TYPE OF LOOP 

1 -> while loop
2 -> do/whilw loop
3 -> for loop
4 -> for/in loop
5 -> for each loop

#  WHILE LOOP 
> while loop if we want to write 1 thing in 100 times 
then we use loops 
the loops are stands in three step 
```javascript
initialize
    |  
condition 
    |
increment / decrement
```
### <u>LOOPS </U>
>LOOP IS DIVIDED IN 3 PARTS 
(INITIALIZATION , CONDITION INCREMENT OR DECREMENT )
1 -> INITIALIZATION IS HAVE TO MAKE THAT ONE VALUE THAT WE HAVE TO RUN 
2 -> CONDITION IF CONDITION IS TRUE THE THIRD PART IS USABLE IF CONDITION IS FALSE THE 3RD PART IS NOT USABLE 
3 -> THE THIRD PART IS INCREMNT , DECREMENT IF YOU WANT TO COME UPER TO LOWER THEN USE DECREMENT AND IF U WANT TO COME LOWER TO UPER THE USE INCREMENT 
THERE ARE FIVE (5) TYPE OF LOOS 

so the pattern is to make while loop 
```javascript
increment loop

var a = 1

while(a<=10){
    document.write("this is increment while loop")
    a++
}
decrement loop
var a = 10

while(a >= 1){
    document.write("this is decrement while loop")
    a--
}
