> WHAT IS SORT AND REVERSE ELEMENT ?

> First of all we talk about sort 

# SORT()
> sort stands to make all array sequense vise like with there first character i explain u 
ex ->  you give a string arrey like ("danish"),("fayyaz"),("adanan")to you know all alphabate 
A   -> ADANAN
B
C
D   ->DANISH
E
F   -> FAYYAZ
G
H
I
J
K
L
M
N
O
P
Q
R
S
T
U
V
W
X
Y
Z
ADNAN FIRST LATTER IS A SO ADANAN RUNS FIRST BUT WE GIVE ADNAN TO 3 BUT IF WE ADD SORT() METHOD THEN ADNAN COME 1ST 
SAME WITH 
FAYYAZ AND DANISH 
SO THE PATTERN TO USE THIS IN INTERNAL 
```javascript
var a = ["danish","fayyaz","adnana","ayyaz"]
a.sort()
document.write(a)
if thier ar two same charachter name then the name was sorted with thier number example -> adanan have 6 character
and
ayyaz have only five so adnan is greatre then ayyaz so adanan show first
```
# Reverse()
> reverse stands ro givea reverse value 
ex -> if u give string or any kind of data type but in this i give string so
we give this value ["danish","adanan","fayyaz"]
so if we use reverse method then the value show like that 
["fayyaz","adanan","danish"]
so the pattern to use this in input is 
```javascript
var a = ["danish","fayyaz","adnana","ayyaz"]
a.reverse()
document.write(a)
```
