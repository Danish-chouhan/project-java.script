# FUNCTION WITH PARAMETER

> THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNTION AND FUNTION WITH PARAMETER
WE HAVE TO ADD PARREMETER TO FUNTION BECOUSE IF WE HAVE TO WRITE SAME THING WITH OTERS VALUE
```javascript
var a = 1
var b = 2

document.write(a + b)
---
---
var a = 100
var b = 200

document.write(a + b)
---
---
var a = 20
var b = 10

document.write(a + b)
---
---
```
> so this is how we change the value so the pattern to add parameter is
```javascript
function name(fname , lname){
    document.write("name" + fname + "" +lname)
}
name("danish" , "chouhan");
```
