## Ceil
> this method name is ceil and this can give uyou a number of upper poin that i mean if we write (1.233) then this give us 2 becouse if we add any number in decimal form then this will give u uper number 
```javascript
var a = Math.ceil(1.233)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## Floor
> this is opposit brother of ceil becose this will give u a lowwer value as u know that ceil give u a upper value but in this we get loower value  i mean that (2.333) then this will give us (2)
```javascript
var a = Math.Floor(2.233)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## round
> this will give u a round number i mean that if u have 40 after poin(1.40) the this will give u a (1) and if u have a value of 60 after poin(1.60)then this will give u 2
```javascript
var a = Math.round(1.60)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## trunc
trunc will help to remove digits after point i mean that if u give a (1.299)this will give u a (1)this will help to remove digit after points
```javascript
var a = Math.trunc(1.233)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## max
> this will acces all number but give u  single number and that is bigger number 
```javascript
var a = Math.max(1 , 3 , 4, 5 , 6 , 7 )
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## min 
> this is opposite brother of max this will give u a lowest number
```javascript
var a = Math.min(1 , 2 , 3 , 4, 5)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## sqrt
> this is sprt full form is (squar root)
it will give u a squar root of number 
ex - > 5 * 5 = 25 this is a root of 5
```javascript
var a = Math.sqrt(25)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## cbrt
> this is cbrt full form is ( cube root )
it will give u a cube root of number 
ex -> 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 this is cube root of 5
```javascript
var a = Math.cbrt(125)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## POW
> this will have 2 parameter one table and second square (value , square of)
```javascript
var a = Math.pow(2,5)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## random
> this will give u random value it may have a formula => math.floor(Math.random()* 100)+ 2
```javascript
var a = Math.floor(Math.random()* 100)+2
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## abs
```javascript
var a = Math.abs(2 + 5)
documenet.write(a)
```
---
## PI 
> if u want to multiply the number with pi then use it 
```javascript
var a = Math.PI
documenet.write(a)
```
