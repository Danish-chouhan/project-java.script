> there are 3 method to direct creat and appends 
1st -> insertAdjecentElement
2nd -> insertAdjecentHTML
3RD -> insertAdjecentText
now i talk first method then i talk other
## insertAdjecentElement
> you know that we make then we do append 
now the method is changed now we can do anything with the use of insert adjecent 

the method for this this can make only elements and append this will not add text so this is pattern 
```javascript
var a = document.createElement("h1")
var b = document.createTextNode("hlw i m danish chouhan")

a.appendChild(b)
var c = document.getElementById("a1")

c.insertAdjacentElement("afterbegin",a)
```
> now i tell u one more thing
there are 4 method to show them there 
1st - beforebegin
2nd - afterbegin
3rd - beforeending 
4th - afterending
these method are usable like this
![usage method](../image/Screenshot%20from%202022-11-19%2022-19-21.png)
so we add two parameter first is location and second is which one ypu want to add

## insertAdjecentHTML
> in this we cn add into one line the method id 
```javascript
var c = document.getElementById("a1")

var d = "<h2>hlw this is only test</h2><br><p>i m just testing the data</p>"

c.insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin",d)
```
> in this we can add into one line and tats our question?
so i tell u how 
firs make variabe and call getElementById
and then make one more variable and write text with element direct into doubledots 
and now
make insertadjecent 
and first call the 1st variable and give property of adjecent and then make parameter in the parameter 1st add location and then after comma add which u want to append

## insertAdjecentHTML
> all method is same but you write insertAdjecentText to the possition of insert adjesent so the pattern is 
```javascript
var c = document.getElementById("a1")
var e = "test is over now"

c.insertAdjacentText("afterbegin",e)
```
> SO THIS IS INSERT ADJECENT TEXT METHOD
