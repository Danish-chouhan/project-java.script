# DO WHILE LOOP 

> THERE ARE SOME DIFFERNENCE BETWEEN WHILE LOOP AND DO WHILE LOOP 
I (WHILE LOOP ) WE USSE THIS RULE 
```javascript
initialize
    |  
condition 
    |
increment / decrement
```
BUT IN (DO WHILE LOOP)WE USE THIS RULE
```javascript
initialize
    |  
increment / decrement
    |
condition
```
i (do while loop ) we represent the rules 
like this first wwe use initialization then increment and decrent and then condition
so the pattern is to do this loop 
```javascript
var a = 1
do{
    document.write("so this is the do while loop")

    a++
}while( a <= 10)
```
