> now we talk abut constant varible (const)
you all know that const is a saperate variable that cannot be a second time usable 
> now question is how to use constant variabe in array and object ?
>now i tel u how can we use const in array or object
## array
```javascript
const a = [10 , 20 , 30]

a[1] = 23
a[2] = 20
document.write(a)
```
> in this if u asign second time there have a error and ur command wil not work becouse of we can not direct assign a const for 2nd time but we have special trick to do what we want (a[1] = 23) in this we are saying that a array index change value to 23 form 20 
and its work same with object

## object
```javascript
const b = {
    name : "danish",
    age : 17
}
b.name = "danuuu"
b.age = 17.5
document.write(b.name + "  " + b.age)
```
> this is object 
same as compare of array
