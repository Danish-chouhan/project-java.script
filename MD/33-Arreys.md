> what is array ?

>Array is from data type every thing that we put iside of square bracket is arrey how array work 
so thisi the pattern 
```javascript
var a = [10;20;30;40;50]
document.write(a)
if we want to show 1, 1 itemsthen we put square bracket in document 
document.write(a[0])
what is 0 ? in arrey we macth single-single things with table so table is start from 0 to  word no 
ex -> we put 10,20,30,40,50
in this 10 is 0 ;
20 is 1
30 is 2
40 is 3 
50 is 4
so this is how we use the table
```
