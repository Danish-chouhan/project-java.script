> we have one condition and we have to show noter one then use condition-terenary-operator
this operator helps to find value of second condition
```javascript
structure => (condition)? true statement : false statement ;
we have 2 method to write this in practicle
----------
1st method
----------
var a = 100;
var b;
(a==100)? b = "True" : b = "False";

document.write(b)
----------
2st method
----------
b - (a==100) "True" : "Fayyaz"

document.write(b)
```
